//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
let alien_color = "Green";
//a-Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
if (alien_color == "Green") {
    console.log("Kudos! You have earned 5 points");
}

//b-Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
//Continuing the part a, if fails
if (alien_color !== "Green") {
    console.log();
